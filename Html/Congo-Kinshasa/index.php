		<h2>The creation of a country</h2>
						
		<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is a country situated in the center of Africa.<br/>
		The country was created before the colonisation periode and belonged to the King Leopold <br/>
		of Belgium.
		It has created in 1888 at Berlin.<br/>
		The ambassador of Portugal,France, United Kingdom and the representative of King <br/>
		Leopold took place that year to divide Africa after creating The Congo as a free state
		</p>
		
		<h2> A long way to freedom</h2>

		 height="200" alt=" Lumumba" title="The first Prime minister, Sir Patrice Lumumba)" id="lumumba" />
		<p>During the Colonisation, The congolese was sent on the ground or in the forest <br/>
		in order to exploit the country because the king needs money. And at that time the industry,<br/>
		which was rapidly expanding, was looking for raw materials.<br/>
		So people who normaly harvest the own culture in order to survive,<br/>
		was sent somewhere else and the diseases, starvation, and torture was a new<br/>
		visage of that free state. After a long time of colonisation and suffering, in 1960,<br/>
		the congolese people gain the independence thanks to Sir Lumumba.<br/>
		The main man who lead a one nation throug the freedom in spite of repression.<br/>
		A group musician created a music for that event, called independance cha-cha.

		<h2>A beautiful Country</h2>
		
		<h3>The beautiful country</h3>
		<img src="http://webservices.missouriwestern.edu/users/lmukunaciowela/act211/hmwk01/Pic_and_ico/the_Congo_River.jpg" 
		 height="200" title="The Congo River, near the town of Kinsangani)" id="congo_river" alt="Congo River" />
		<p>"The most amazing thing of this country is the Congo River. It's one of the longest,<br/>
		beautiful and powerful river in the world.<br/></p>
		You can visit the Virunga Park, it is the oldest and the biggest park of Africa.<br/>
		An intense forest is situated on a half that country. That forest lets central african<br/>
		people breath fresh and clean air.<br/>
		It also brings foods, water, and a lot of thing that help people to survive in the wild.</p>
		
		<h3>The amazing people</h3>
		
		<p>
		
		That country counts at least 400 etnic group. So after French, which is the national language,<br/>
		lingala, kikongo, ciluba, swahili are the four languages speak in Congo DR. However we can find<br/>
		language speak by minorities but it will disapear soon	and unfortunately some have already disapeared.
